        <h2>Personal Development</h2>
        <p class="article"> A crucial realization I made during the onboarding phase of the Road to Hire Apprenticeship Program was the importance of effective time management. Staying organized and setting clear priorities
        are essential for maintaining a steady workflow. Once I began planning
        my days more intentionally-setting personal deadlines, I noticed how much more productive I became. This experience helped me realize that time management isn't just about completing tasks but about creating a space to learn without feeling overwhelmed.

        <h2>Professional Development</h2>
        <p class="article">During my time in the program, I've come to realize the importance of maintaining a balance between professionalism and authenticity. I've become more aware of how to present myself in different environments and how small details, such as attire and body language, can influence how I'm perceived. This balance has helped me become more adaptable while still standing out in my own unique way. </p>

        <h2>Technical Development</h2>
        <p class="article">Entering the Road to Hire Program with no prior coding experience was both exciting and challenging. I realized how important it is to stay consistent when learning something new. Practicing regularly and celebrating small wins has helped me build confidence in what I've learned so far. This experience has taught me to welcome mistakes as part of the process and to keep adapting and moving forward, I plan to continue strengthening my coding skills and abilities in coding.</p>
